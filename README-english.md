MyDEX â€“ Global Decentralized Exchange Network

Overview and Objectives

MyDEX (name not finalized and subject to change) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on a Layer-2 architecture. It enables cryptocurrency trading across multiple blockchains without the need for a central authority. Built in Rust, the system prioritizes trustlessness, security, and modularity. MyDEX combines an off-chain order book infrastructure with on-chain settlements via Atomic Swaps, ensuring rapid trading and secure, immutable transactions. Fullnodes play a crucial role by operating the network, validating all transactions, and receiving a share of the trading fees as decentralized rewards.

This documentation provides a technical overview of MyDEX's architecture, technology stack, core functionalities and modules, smart contracts in use, and security mechanisms. Additionally, it outlines the incentive structure for fullnode operators and recommendations for developers to facilitate easy onboarding into the project.

Architectural Overview

MyDEX is designed as a distributed system consisting of multiple peer-to-peer fullnodes. Each fullnode executes all core components of the DEX and communicates with other nodes to maintain a synchronized state of the exchange. Key architectural features include:

Distributed Order Book Architecture

Instead of maintaining a centralized blockchain-based order book, MyDEX replicates the order book off-chain across all fullnodes using gossip protocols and conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs).

Off-Chain Matching, On-Chain Settlement

The order matching engine operates off-chain, whereas the actual trade settlement is executed on-chain, primarily through Atomic Swaps.

Modular Components

The software is clearly modularized into:

Network Layer (peer-to-peer communication, Kademlia DHT, Noise protocol)

Order Book and Trading Logic

Settlement Engine (Atomic Swaps, payment channels)

Consensus and Validation Layer (Nakamoto, PBFT, Proof-of-Stake)

Storage and Database Layer (RocksDB, IPFS)

Identity and Access Layer (user accounts, key management, HSM integration)

Monitoring and Self-Regulation (Prometheus, heartbeats, security checks)

Off-Chain/On-Chain Communication

Bitcoin and UTXO chains: Integration via Bitcoin Core RPC

Ethereum: Smart contracts via ethers-rs

Lightning Network: Payment channels via native implementation or external Lightning nodes

Node Structure & Roles

Gatekeeper Phase: Initial security checks for new nodes

Committee Phase: Final voting for node acceptance

Fullnode Status: Equal rights for all nodes after successful onboarding

Technology Stack

MyDEX leverages Rust (Edition 2021), asynchronous programming with Tokio, and extensively uses Rust crates such as Serde, Bincode, Tracing, and Criterion.
